# Anonymous viewing of Insta Stories

Instagram stories provide a quick peek into someoneâ€™s life. However, they are available only for 24 hours and every attempt to display them is recorded in the view history, so there is no question of user anonymity here.

If you are looking for a method for anonymous browsing of Instagram stories, it is worth visiting [**Instagram Stories & Highlights Viewer**](https://insta-story-viewer.pl/). Thanks to this free tool, the author of the story will not find out about seeing it. The view history is not saved anywhere.

But it is not everything. Insta Story Viewer also offers stalking of user highlights. All quickly, anonymously and in high definition.
